Each coin’s side (Heads or Tails) shows which player it belongs to.

Setup
    Front Row (Spears):
Each player places four copper coins on their second row (dark squares only).
    Back Row (Draft):
Players take turns placing one coin at a time into their back row (four coins total per side).
You can place any mix of copper, silver, or gold coins.
The first player is decided by a coin flip.
Taking Turns
The first player is decided by a coin flip, then players alternate turns. 
On your turn:
Move one piece diagonally forward by one square into an empty dark square,
Or
Capture by jumping diagonally over an adjacent enemy piece that your unit can defeat (per the RPS rules).
If you capture, land on the empty square beyond.
Multiple captures in one turn are allowed, as long as each jump follows the RPS rules.
Promotions: Veterans
When a piece reaches the far row (the opponent’s back row):
It becomes a Veteran.
To promote, stack a second coin on top (your choice: copper, silver, or gold).
A Veteran may capture or be captured by any enemy that its two coin types.
Veterans can also move backward diagonally.
If a Veteran is captured, both coins are claimed by the opponent.
End of Game
The game ends immediately when:
One player has no remaining pieces,
or
Has no legal moves available.
Captured coins are kept by the capturing player.
